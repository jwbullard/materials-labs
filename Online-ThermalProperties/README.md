## NOTES

### Veracity of website calculator

A major component of this lab involves the students using an online calculator provided
by the Engineering ToolBox website.  Instructors should check that the URL provided for
that site is still accurate.

### Editing the instructions

Feel free to edit the lab instruction sheet.  You can do this by editing the LaTeX
file and then converting it to a PDF using the command

`pdflatex ThermalPropsLab`

This will require a full LaTeX distribution such as TeXLive, which can be downloaded
at <https://tug.org/texlive>

### Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter notebook provided in this folder can be used to modify the plot or to make
plots of your own if you desire.  Running the notebook requires Python 3.x, and a full
Python environment such as Anaconda is recommended. (<https://www.anaconda.com>)
